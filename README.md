# Gatotkaca - Otot Kawat Tulang Besi

**Otot Kawat Tulang Besi** is Indonesian language, in English **Iron Bone Wire Muscle** which mean his bone strong as iron, and his muscle strong as wire.

This is platformer game created in 2011 using JAVA, when I was in collage. Don't expect this game so amazing, it far from it. I created when I wasn't expert enough in programming especially in game development which now I choose to be web developer instead game developer.

The biggest issue in this source code is memory management. 

This game is for educational purpose only, you cannot use it for commercial use.
